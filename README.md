A dataset of 4585 rows and 11 features was analyzed. It contained information about coal production, payment of economic compensations for royalties and compensations, mining projects, and their location (departmental and municipal) from 2012 to 2020.

**Here are the questions that were answered**

* What is the annual coal production (2012 – 2020)?

* How much did COVID-19 affect coal production and royalty generation?

* Which departments have the highest and lowest coal production and royalties?

* Which mining projects have provided economic compensation to the Colombian state as compensation?
